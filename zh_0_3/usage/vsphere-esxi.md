### falcon-vsphere
这是一个适用于Open-Falcon的，用于监控Vsphere及由Vsphere监管的所有esxi性能指标的agent。地址:[https://github.com/tpinellia/vsphere](https://github.com/tpinellia/vsphere)
#### 一.特性
1. 支持多vsphere同时采集
2. 支持vsphere与esxi监控项归并/拆分,支持自定义endpoint或监控项头部
3. esxi监控项包含基础跟扩展监控两类，扩展监控可选择启用，同时可配置
4. 配置支持热加载(例如添加vsphere,增删扩展监控等等)，不需要重新启动agent
#### 二.使用说明
1. export WorkDir="$HOME/falcon-vsphere"
2. mkdir -p $WorkDir
3. tar -xzvf falcon-vsphere-x.x.x.tar.gz -C $WorkDir
4. cd $WorkDir
5. ./control start
#### 三.配置说明

**类型声明**

|NAME|DESCRIPTION|
|-|-|
|absolute|Represents an actual value, level, or state of the counter. For example, the “uptime” counter (system group) represents the actual number of seconds since startup. The “capacity” counter represents the actual configured size of the specified datastore. In other words, number of samples, samplingPeriod, and intervals have no bearing on an “absolute” counter“s value.|
|delta|Represents an amount of change for the counter during the samplingPeriod as compared to the previous interval. The first sampling interval|
|rate|Represents a value that has been normalized over the samplingPeriod, enabling values for the same counter type to be compared, regardless of interval. For example, the number of reads per second.|
